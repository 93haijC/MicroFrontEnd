# MicroFrontEnd
Demo for Microfrontend in ReactJS
## Purpose
This demo is to redesign Agero OneRoad platform in a Micro-frontend way. Instead of a monolith product, this demo is trying to separate OneRoad into several separte self-contained Micro-frontends. Each Micro-frontend will be developed and maintained independently with a more explicit data flow and workflow which makes it easier for OR platform team to locate and solve issues and develop new features.
